Description:

This test ensures that the Levl SoC is overwritten by the Levl request
(while adding the energy already realized within the current request cycle).

Config setup:

Battery capacity: 10kWh
Current soc: 10% --> 1kWh
Max grid power: 10kW

Production: 1000W
Consumption: 8000W
--> Consumption surplus: 7000W

Current cycle discharge energy: 36000Ws (=10Wh)
Current cycle realized discharge energy: 2600Ws (=1Wh)
Current cycle remaining discharge energy: 32400Ws (=9Wh)

Total realized discharge energy (inverted Levl SoC): -1.000Wh
--> Levl  has charged 1.000Wh on balance, thus all the energy in the battery is reserved for Levl, PUC must not use this energy

Request setup:

New Levl SoC: 900Wh (total realized discharge energy: -900Wh)

Desired behaviour:

At first, Levl charges the battery. Thus, total realized energy decreases.
Primary use case cannot discharge because all energy is reserved for Levl.
After request is received, levl Soc is updated to a lower value. As a result, the primary use case can discharge now.
