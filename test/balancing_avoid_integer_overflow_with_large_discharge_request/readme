Checks if a levl charge/discharge request's amount of power to realize does not cause
an integer overflow, but is stored as a long instead.

Target Power W = 2500000
Converted to Ws in quarter hour: 2500000 * 900 = 2250000000
Maximum int is                                   2147483647

With integer overflow, we would get -2044967296
